# MovieLens_Project
  This project part of the capstone project of the EdX course ‘HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone’. It's created for a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The version of movielens included in the R dslabs package (which was used for some of the exercises in PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning) is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings. You can find the entire latest MovieLens dataset here. I add a recommendation system using most of the knowledge gained through out the 8 topics of the data science course. I have used the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation and machine learning algorithm a little easier.  You need to download the MovieLens data and run code we will provide to generate your datasets.
